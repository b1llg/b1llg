## Introduction:
### Hi, my name is Billy and I'm a finite element analyst.
- ðŸŽ“ I completed a master degree in mechanical engineering (M.A.Sc.) where I designed a novel variable cross section extrusion die. I did lots of fe analysis with LS-DYNA. I coded some Fortran, did statiscal analysis with R, data analysis with Python and Matlab.
- ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently working as a finite element analyst using Optistruct and Radioss
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning C++ as I want to develop my own FE tools and solvers
- ðŸ’ª Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on finite element project either in C++, Python or Fortran
  - Preferably C++
  - I'm interessted to learn about parralel applications and GPU programming

## Languages:
- Python 
- C++ (In the process of mastering this language)
- Matlab
- Fortran
