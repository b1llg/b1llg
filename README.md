### Hi, my name is Billy and I'm a finite element analyst.
- 🎓 I completed a master degree in mechanical engineering (M.A.Sc.) where I designed a novel variable cross section extrusion die. I did lots of fe analysis with LS-DYNA. I coded some Fortran, did statiscal analysis with R, data analysis with Python and Matlab.
- 🔧 I’m currently working as a finite element analyst using Optistruct and Radioss
- 📚 I’m currently learning C++ as I want to develop my own FE tools and solvers
- 💪 I’m looking to collaborate on finite element project either in Fortran or C++

## Languages:
- Matlab
- Fortran
- Python
- C++
